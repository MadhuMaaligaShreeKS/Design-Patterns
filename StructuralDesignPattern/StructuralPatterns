Adapter Pattern
    Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. 
    This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.

Bridge Pattern
    Bridge is used when we need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
    This pattern involves an interface which acts as a bridge which makes the functionality of concrete classes independent from interface implementer classes.
    Both types of classes can be altered structurally without affecting each other.

Composite Pattern
    Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy.
    This pattern creates a class that contains group of its own objects. This class provides ways to modify its group of same objects.

Decorator Pattern
    Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.
    This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.
