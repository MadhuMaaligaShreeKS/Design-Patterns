# Interpreter Design Pattern
The Interpreter design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that facilitates the interpretation and evaluation of expressions or language grammars. It provides a mechanism to evaluate sentences in a language by representing their grammar as a set of classes. Each class represents a rule or expression in the grammar, and the pattern allows these classes to be composed hierarchically to interpret complex expressions.

Key Components of the Interpreter Design Pattern:

**AbstractExpression:**
This is an abstract class or interface that declares an abstract interpret() method.
It represents the common interface for all concrete expressions in the language.
Abstract expressions define the behavior for interpreting language elements.
For example, an arithmetic expression interpreter might have an abstract expression for evaluating numeric literals or variables.

**TerminalExpression:**
These are concrete classes that implement the AbstractExpression interface.
Terminal expressions represent the terminal symbols or leaves in the grammar.
They are the basic building blocks that the interpreter uses to interpret the language.
For instance, in an arithmetic expression interpreter:
Terminal expressions could include literals (such as numbers) or variables representing numeric values.
Terminal expressions directly evaluate to their respective values without further decomposition.

**NonterminalExpression:**
These are also concrete classes that implement the AbstractExpression interface.
Non-terminal expression classes handle composite expressions, which consist of multiple sub-expressions.
They provide the interpretation logic for such composite expressions.
Additionally, non-terminal expressions coordinate the interpretation process by managing the interpretation of sub-expressions.
For example, in a boolean expression interpreter:
Non-terminal expressions could handle logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT) involving sub-expressions.

**Context:**
The context contains information necessary for interpreting an expression.
It provides the environment in which expressions are evaluated.
The context may store variables, constants, or other relevant data needed during interpretation.
