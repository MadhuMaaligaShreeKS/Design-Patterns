The Factory Design Pattern centralizes object creation logic, effectively hiding the details of object instantiation from the client code.

Consider an example ,
If a customer has to buy an os for iphone 
The customer goes to  shop and asks for os and he does not need to know about what type of os  iphone need .
The shopkeeper will have os like ios ,android ,windows  
When the customer asks for this the shopkeeper decides which os has to be given to the customer.
Here ,
Class will be Operating Systems	
Subclasses will be os versions 
Object will be the os given to the customer.
