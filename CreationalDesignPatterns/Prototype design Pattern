Prototype design Pattern 
    Used for creating new objects by cloning other objects
    The existing object acts as a prototype and contains the state of the object.
    The newly copied object may change the same properties only if required.
    One of the best available ways to create an object from existing objects is the clone() method. 
    Clone is the simplest approach for implementing a prototype pattern.
