# Design-Patterns

Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software development.

For example, while constructing a building we wouldnâ€™t start from scratch everytime rather we use blueprints or established construction techniques.

Similarly , design patterns are blueprints or templates that can be adapted to a specific situation.

Generally a pattern consists of the following 

	Intent : describes both the problem and the solution.
		Problem specifies the programming challenge the pattern addresses.
		Solution is the general approach that pattern offers to solve a problem.
	Motivation : 
		It further explains the problem and the solution 
		Understanding the motivation gives context to the solution and why the pattern exists.
	Structure : 
		It consists of the following ,
			Classes and objects that make up the pattern
			Roles and Responsibilities that each class or object performs within the solution.
			Explains the relationship between the classes and objects and how they interact to achieve desired functionality.
	Code :  
        using any of the programming language the concept behind the pattern is demonstrated.

Classification of patterns
	
Patterns are categorized based on their intent
		
		Creational Patterns - deals with the object creation in a flexible manner.
		Structural Patterns - focuses on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures
		Behavioral Patterns - focuses on how objects communicate and collaborate with each other to achieve specific behavior.
